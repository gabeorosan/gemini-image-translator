# Loading Box Improvements

## ✅ **Draggable Loading Box**

### What Changed:
- **Loading Box is Draggable**: Users can now drag the loading indicator while translation is in progress
- **Position Memory**: If user drags the loading box, that position is saved and used for the translation result
- **Consistent Behavior**: Both loading and translation boxes have identical drag functionality

### How It Works:
1. **Loading Appears**: Loading box shows up at saved position (or default)
2. **User Can Drag**: While translation is processing, user can drag loading box to preferred location
3. **Position Saved**: New position is automatically saved
4. **Translation Appears**: Translation result appears in exact same spot where loading box was dragged to

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Immediate Adjustment**: Don't have to wait for translation to finish to reposition
- ✅ **Seamless Transition**: Translation appears exactly where loading box was positioned
- ✅ **User Control**: Can position box optimally while translation is processing

## ✅ **Clean Replacement Logic**

### What Changed:
- **No Overlap**: Starting a new translation while one is open cleanly replaces the old one
- **Single Box**: Only one translation/loading box visible at a time
- **Smooth Transition**: Old translation disappears, loading appears in same position

### Previous Behavior (Janky):
```
┌─────────────────┐
│ Old Translation │
└─────────────────┘
┌─────────────────┐  ← Loading box appeared below
│ Loading...      │     creating visual clutter
└─────────────────┘
```

### New Behavior (Clean):
```
┌─────────────────┐
│ Old Translation │  → Gets replaced by →  ┌─────────────────┐
└─────────────────┘                        │ Loading...      │
                                          └─────────────────┘
```

### Technical Implementation:
```javascript
function showLoadingIndicator() {
  // Remove any existing loading indicator AND translation result
  hideLoadingIndicator();
  const existingResult = document.getElementById('gemini-translation-result');
  if (existingResult) {
    existingResult.remove();
  }
  
  // Show new loading box
  // Make it draggable
  makeDraggable(loadingOverlay);
}
```

## **User Experience Flow**

### Scenario 1: First Translation
1. **Select Area**: User selects text to translate
2. **Loading Shows**: Loading box appears at default position
3. **User Drags**: User drags loading box to preferred corner
4. **Translation Appears**: Translation replaces loading in same position
5. **Position Saved**: Location remembered for future use

### Scenario 2: Second Translation (With First Still Open)
1. **Select New Area**: User selects different text while first translation is still visible
2. **Clean Replace**: Old translation disappears, loading appears at saved position
3. **Optional Drag**: User can drag loading box to new position if desired
4. **New Translation**: New translation appears where loading box is positioned

### Scenario 3: Repositioning During Loading
1. **Select Area**: User selects text
2. **Loading Shows**: Loading box appears
3. **Immediate Drag**: User drags loading box to better position while translation is processing
4. **Translation Appears**: Translation appears exactly where loading box was dragged to
5. **New Default**: Dragged position becomes new saved location

## **Benefits**

### Improved User Control:
- ✅ **Real-Time Positioning**: Can adjust position while translation is processing
- ✅ **No Waiting**: Don't have to wait for translation to finish to reposition
- ✅ **Immediate Feedback**: See exactly where translation will appear

### Clean Interface:
- ✅ **No Overlap**: Only one box visible at a time
- ✅ **Smooth Transitions**: Clean replacement of old content with new
- ✅ **No Visual Clutter**: Eliminates janky multiple-box appearance

### Consistent Behavior:
- ✅ **Same Drag Logic**: Loading and translation boxes behave identically
- ✅ **Position Continuity**: Loading position becomes translation position
- ✅ **Memory System**: Position changes are immediately saved and remembered

## **Technical Benefits**

### Unified Drag System:
- **Single Function**: `makeDraggable()` works for both loading and translation boxes
- **Consistent Handlers**: Same mouse event handling for both box types
- **Position Sync**: Dragging either box updates the saved position

### Clean State Management:
- **Proper Cleanup**: Old boxes are removed before showing new ones
- **No Orphaned Elements**: Prevents accumulation of hidden DOM elements
- **Memory Efficiency**: Only one translation box exists at a time

### Responsive Design:
- **Viewport Bounds**: Both loading and translation boxes stay within screen
- **Position Validation**: Ensures boxes don't go off-screen when restored
- **Cross-Session**: Position memory works across browser sessions

This update provides a much more polished and user-friendly experience where users have complete control over positioning at any time, and the interface remains clean and predictable.
